- rewrite to be sure to take into account multiple value keys. For instance, if you have
one or several variables on a part name, you can consider this set becomes a key and if there are
variables in the options we only consider values that for which key values match those of
the part. The same can apply when the left part of an option has one or several variables
then variables on the right part can only apply to values that have the same key values
(the ones from the left part).
